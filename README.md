## Purpose ##

**Keyup**:

* is a safe, error-free mechanism to rotate (renew) access keys to Amazon Web Services as
frequently as you wish, with minimal effort and risk.

* enables you to change your access keys when required by executing a single command from the cli.

* Alternatively, enter a keyup command in your crontab with the ``` --auto ``` parameter and renew access
keys on a daily schedule.

* **keyup** requires only the profile name of your IAM user in your local [awscli configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/):

```bash

    $ keyup  --profile johndoe  --operation up

```
